One of the Swing UI tool that I am working on serializes its settings to xml using [xstream](http://x-stream.github.io/).
Most of these settings were layout configurations for trade blotters like positions on a screen,
some specific properties of a view, etc.

Everything was fine with them by the time when you need to change something in xml marshalled classes.
Ideally, you should not touch incapsulated fields of those classes, otherwise they may not be properly deserialized from xml
and user's settings may be lost. This restriction limits you in refactoring and development
in general, because you must check that your changes haven't broken anything in xml deserialization.

So, this *flexibility-vs-stability* problem can be decomposed into 2 subtasks:

1. we must be sure that old settings can be restored without data loss
2. we need xml versioning and a mechanism to deserialize java objects from old versions

## Using reflections to identify deserialization issues
Subtask #1 can be implemented as a unit test:

```
    for all versions settings.xml (one per app release)
        check that xml unmarshalled to java objects without exceptions
```
*(Disclaimer: though I think that [deserialization](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/770474/what-is-the-difference-between-serialization-and-marshaling) is the best term that describe the process of saving a state of an object to xml,
 [unmarshalling](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/Unmarshaller.html) is more familiar for java developers. I use these words as synonyms.)*

Checking successful deserialization is quite trivial with xstream: you just need to make sure that this procedure happened without
[ConversionException](https://x-stream.github.io/javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/converters/ConversionException.html).

Gathering settings for previous releases is more tricky, but with java reflection and a bit of cool open source libraries
it is also quite easy.
I gathered all the marshalled classes (views subclasses, in my case) with [org.reflections](https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections),
 after that I generated beans of these classes with [random-beans](https://github.com/benas/random-beans) and marshalled them with xstream.
Test is [here](https://gist.github.com/astukalo/229f7b12fd56cf08dc4e484a0a4964b1).

Alas, you need to run this simple tool for previous versions (not all, but which you currently support) of a product, but only once.

I also added [one more unit-test](https://gist.github.com/astukalo/a401a39b2b90423387758ac11423c953) which I run only with maven `prod` profile.
It checks that the latest settings of the current version has been serialized. We will use this file for unmarshalling validation.

That's it.
Let's move to task #2 and topic itself.

## Xstream Migration Tool aka [XMT](https://github.com/astukalo/xmt)
First I tried to find an open source tool for xml versioning and migration and come across this article
[Migrate Serialized Java Objects with XStream and XMT](https://dzone.com/articles/migrate-serialized-java).
I have checked [XMT](http://wiki.pmease.com/display/xmt/Documentation+Home), played with it a bit and found
  that it doesn't suite me, though the idea seems appealing.

What doesn't satisfy my needs is that versioning and migration works only for a root element and not for nested.
I decided to fork it and enhance it a bit.

I won't copy the description of XMT tool here, it has a pretty good [Getting started](http://wiki.pmease.com/display/xmt/Getting+Started).
and [my forked version](https://github.com/astukalo/xmt) works pretty much the same.

So, what was changed/added:

1. Added annotation [`@NeedMigration`](https://github.com/astukalo/xmt/blob/master/src/main/java/xyz/a5s7/xmt/NeedMigration.java). You need to mark a class with this annotation in order to activate migration.
2. When you save objects with `toXML()`, even nested element will contain version, if it is annotated:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <xyz.a5s7.xmt.bean.BeanWithMigration>
       <str>test</str>
       <dbl>1231.6</dbl>
       <!--this field was removed from java-->
       <i>5</i>
       <nestedBean version="1">
           <i>35</i>
           <str>nnnnn</str>
       </nestedBean>
   </xyz.a5s7.xmt.bean.BeanWithMigration>
   ```
   (In this example you can see that for the parent class `version` attribute can be omitted, it is 0 by default.)
3. `private void migrate1(VersionedDocument dom, Stack<Integer> versions)` changed to
`private void migrate1(DefaultElement dom, Deque<Integer> versions)`
4. Added [`IgnoreUnknownElementsMapConverter`](https://github.com/astukalo/xmt/blob/master/src/main/java/xyz/a5s7/xmt/IgnoreUnknownElementsMapConverter.java), which ignores unknown classes in map (i.e. removed in the new versions).
The same IgnoreUnknownElementsCollectionConverter may be required as well, but I haven't added it yet.

The best way to check how it works is to take a look at unit test: [XMTTest](https://github.com/astukalo/xmt/blob/master/src/test/java/xyz/a5s7/xmt/XMTTest.java).
